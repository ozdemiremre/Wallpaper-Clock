 *Only font selection is effective. Other options don't change the behaviour of the program.*

 - **Change the color**

 In order to make the clock visible on all backgrounds, the program selects the outline color itself with complementary colors in mind.

 *If you choose white, it'll select black as the outline and vice versa. I plan to adding the option to change the outline color.*

 - **Shuffle the images**

 The option to go through the folder alphabetically or by random selection!
 
 - **Set the wallpaper change interval**

 You can set how frequent the wallpaper will change between 1 to 60 minutes. 
 - **Hide the app icon from taskbar**

 Minimizing the app will make the icon disappear from the taskbar.
 
 - **Set AutoStartup**

 Let the program create a shortcut in the startup folder so it can be opened on every windows startup. 
 *You can disable this by unchecking the box.*
